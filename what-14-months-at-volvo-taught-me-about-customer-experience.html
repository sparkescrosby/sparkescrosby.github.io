<p>When I started my internship at Volvo Car Ireland as a Marketing and CX intern fresh out of my undergrad in Marketing Innovation and New Technology at DCU, I thought I understood customer experience. I was wrong.</p>

            <p>Luxury automotive CX isn't just about premium leather seats and smooth rides. It's about understanding every single touchpoint in the customer journey—from the moment someone sees a Volvo ad on Instagram to the day they bring their car in for its first service three years later.</p>

            <h2>The Gap Between Marketing Theory and Reality</h2>

            <p>In university, we learned about customer journey mapping, touchpoint optimization, and omnichannel strategy. But sitting in a classroom discussing theoretical frameworks is completely different from watching a real customer get frustrated because the handover process took 45 minutes instead of 30.</p>

            <p>Here's what 14 months in the field taught me that no textbook could:</p>

            <h3>1. CX is Everyone's Job (But Also No One's)</h3>

            <p>One of the biggest lessons I learned is that customer experience doesn't live in a single department. The sales team affects it. The service technicians affect it. The finance team affects it. Even the person who answers the phone affects it.</p>

            <p>But here's the problem: when everyone owns it, no one owns it. That's why having a dedicated CX function—even as an intern—was crucial. Someone needs to be the voice of the customer across all departments.</p>

            <h3>2. Data Tells You What, Conversations Tell You Why</h3>

            <p>We had access to incredible data at Volvo. NPS scores, customer satisfaction metrics, digital analytics, you name it. But the real insights came from actually talking to customers.</p>

            <p>I remember one particular case where our post-purchase survey scores were dropping. The data showed dissatisfaction, but it didn't tell us why. After conducting follow-up calls with ten customers, we discovered the issue wasn't the car at all—it was confusion about the subscription services and digital features.</p>

            <p>The fix? A simple follow-up email three days after purchase with a clear explainer video. NPS went up by 8 points in the next quarter.</p>

            <h3>3. Premium Doesn't Mean Perfect</h3>

            <p>Volvo is a premium brand, but that doesn't mean every customer interaction is flawless. What separates a premium experience from a standard one isn't the absence of problems—it's how you handle them when they arise.</p>

            <p>I watched our service team turn a frustrated customer whose car needed an unexpected repair into a brand advocate simply by being transparent, offering a premium loaner, and following up personally after the repair was complete.</p>

            <blockquote>The goal isn't perfection. The goal is making customers feel valued, heard, and taken care of when things inevitably go wrong.</blockquote>

            <h2>Translating This to Strategy</h2>

            <p>Now that I'm pursuing my MSc in Strategic Management at UCD Smurfit, I can see how these CX lessons tie directly into broader business strategy. Customer experience isn't a "nice to have"—it's a competitive advantage and a key differentiator in saturated markets.</p>

            <p>In automotive especially, where product differentiation is getting harder (electric powertrains are becoming commoditized, safety features are table stakes), the experience around the product becomes the product.</p>

            <h2>Key Takeaways for Marketing Students</h2>

            <p>If you're a marketing student looking to break into CX or considering an internship in the space, here's my advice:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Get comfortable with data, but don't hide behind it.</strong> Learn Excel, Google Analytics, whatever tools you can. But also learn how to have real conversations with customers.</li>
                <li><strong>Understand the full business, not just marketing.</strong> Spend time with sales, service, product teams. CX touches everything.</li>
                <li><strong>Document everything.</strong> I kept a running doc of every customer pain point, insight, and win. It became my portfolio.</li>
                <li><strong>Don't be afraid to question processes.</strong> As an intern, you have fresh eyes. Use them. Some of our best improvements came from me asking "why do we do it this way?"</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

            <p>My 14 months at Volvo fundamentally changed how I think about marketing. It's not about campaigns and creative and brand positioning (though those matter). It's about creating value at every interaction, understanding customer needs deeply, and building systems that deliver on brand promises consistently.</p>

            <p>That's the kind of strategic thinking that connects my undergrad in marketing innovation, my time at Volvo, and what I'm learning now at Smurfit. And it's exactly the kind of thinking I'll be exploring more in future posts.</p>

            <p>What's your take? Have you worked in CX? What surprised you most? Let me know—I'm always keen to hear from others in the field.</p>
